# ðŸ”— GitHub Pages URL Shortener

This is a minimal URL shortener that can be entirely hosted on GitHub pages. It
does not need the maintenance of any servers or databases and can be hosted
entirely on GitHub for free!


##  Demo

1. [cdn.bishua.art/1](cdn.bishua.art/1) should link to this repo.

1. To add a new short link, add an issue with the title being the link you want
   to shorten (including the `http(s)://`) to
   [https://github.com/AireWong/URL-Shortener/issues](https://github.com/AireWong/URL-Shortener/issues).

1. The newly created short url can be accessed via `cdn.bishua.art/{issue_number}`
